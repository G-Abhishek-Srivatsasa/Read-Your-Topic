4.  Motion in a Plane (Projectile and Circular Motion)

A.
Motion in a Plane
        1.  Motion in plane is called as motion in two dimensions, e.g. projectile
           motion, circular motion. For the analysis of such motion our reference
           will be made of an origin and two co-ordinate axes X and Y .
        2.  Terms Related to Motion in Plane
            i) Position Vector
                  A vector that extends from a reference point to the point at which
              particle is located is called position vector.

                  Position vector is given by r = x i^ + y j^ + z k^
              Direction of this position vector r is given by the angle q with X-axis, where, tanA = y/x

           ii) Displacement Vector
                 The displacement vector is a vector which gives the position of a point
               with reference to a point other than the origin of the co-ordinate system.

                 Direction of the displacement vector Dr is given by

               tanA = change in y / change in x

          iii) Velocity Vector
                 Velocity of an object in motion is defined as the ratio of displacement
               and the corresponding time interval taken by the object.
                 (i) Average Velocity It is defined as the ratio of the displacement
                     and the corresponding time interval.

                       Average velocity = change in displacement / change in time = r2-r1/t2-t1
