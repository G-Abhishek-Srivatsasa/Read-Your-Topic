      "Motion\n",
      "1.   If an object changes its position with respect to its surroundings with\n",
      "time, then it is called in motion.\n",
      "B.\n",
      "Rest\n",
      "1.   If an object does not change its position with respect to its\n",
      "surroundings with time, then it is called at rest.\n",
      "Rest and motion are relative states. It means an object which is at rest\n",
      "in one frame of reference can be in motion in another frame of\n",
      "reference at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.   Point Object An object can be considered as a point object, if the distance travelled\n",

      "Types of Motion\n",
      "1. One Dimensional Motion\n",
      "If only one out of three coordinates specifying the position of the object\n",
      "changes with respect to time, then the motion is called one dimensional\n",
      "motion or rectilinear motion.\n",

      "Displacement\n",
      "1.  The shortest distance between the initial and final positions of any\n",
